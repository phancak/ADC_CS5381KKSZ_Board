# CS5381 DSP Audio Module

## Overview

This project features a modular audio processing board centered around the **CS5381** â€” a high-performance 24-bit stereo analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with advanced DSP capabilities. The board integrates the **LT1128CS8** low-noise, low-distortion operational amplifier for signal conditioning and the **ICS-40730** digital MEMS microphone for high-fidelity sound capture. Designed as a reusable module, it can be integrated with other PCBs to form part of a larger embedded system or proof-of-concept prototype requiring precise audio acquisition and processing.
